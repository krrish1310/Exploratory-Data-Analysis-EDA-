# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset as part of the AI & ML Internship Task 2.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore and visualize the dataset in order to understand feature relationships, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize key statistics that are useful before building machine learning models.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- **File Used**: `Titanic-Dataset.csv.xls` (provided by the internship)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 EDA Steps Covered

### ✅ Data Understanding
- Loaded and previewed the dataset
- Checked data types and missing values
- Replaced infinite values with NaN

### ✅ Descriptive Statistics
- Used `.describe()` to understand basic statistics

### ✅ Visualization
- Histograms for numerical distributions
- Boxplots to detect outliers
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Pairplot for multivariate insights
- Count plots for categorical features

### ✅ Feature Insights
- Analyzed survival counts based on gender and class
- Computed skewness to detect data distribution asymmetry
